# Brandeis Courses Scraper
## Description
This is a scraper to collect course data for a course evaluation website, deiseval.com. Here I document the process of learning how to use an SQL database.

## Tech Stack
- `Python`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Selenium`

## Database Setup Process
### Install ODBC driver and connect to SQL server

- `pip install --no-binary :all: pyodbc` install error solution 
- `odbcinst -q -d`check if driver is installed
- `sqlcmd -S servername.database.windows.net,1433 -U "username" -P 'password' -Q "use mydb;"` connect to sql server with sqlcmd

### Challenges 
#### Cannot connect to the sql server 
- install pyodbc
- install pymssql but failed to install the library, seems like the library is not compatible with my environment
- checked the firewall setting, the port 1433 is open, and ip address is allowed
- checked the server name, username and password, all correct
- checked the odbc driver, the driver is installed
- tried increasing connection timeout, but still failed

#### Resorted to using postgresql instead
- installed postgresql with postgres.app
- installed psycopg2
- successfully connected to the database
- disadavantage: requries third party cloud service to host the database


## Postgresql Notes
### What is PostgreSQL
- A `server` process accepts connections from client applications, and performs database actions on behalf of the clients.
- A `server` program is called `postgres`.
- A `client` may be a text-oriented tool, a graphical application, a web server that accesses the database for information to be presented on a website.
- relational database management systems (RDBMS)
### Creating a database
- `createdb` is a wrapper around the SQL command `CREATE DATABASE`. 
- `dropdb` is a wrapper around the SQL command `DROP DATABASE`. 
```
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE course_data (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    course varchar(255),
    courseTitle varchar(255),
    syllabus varchar(255),
    instructor varchar(255),
    term varchar(255),
    requirements varchar(255)[], -- Assuming it's an array
    description text
    );''')
```
Ran into an error when creating a database, the error message is 
```bash
createdb: error: connection to server on socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?
```
Solution: used postgres.app instead of homebrew to install postgresql, and it works
- Initialized databse cluster 
### Connecting to a database from python
- `psycopg2` is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
```
connection = psycopg2.connect(
	host="localhost",         # Hostname or IP address of your database server
	database="courses",  # Name of your database
	user="minstonewang",     # Your PostgreSQL username
	password=""  # Your PostgreSQL password
)
cursor = connection.cursor()
    
```
### SQL types 
- `int` is a signed integer that has a maximum precision of 32 bits.
- `smallint` is a signed integer that has a maximum precision of 16 bits.
- `real` is a floating-point number that supports 6 decimal digits of precision.
- `double precision` is a floating-point number that supports 15 decimal digits of precision.
- `char(n)` is a fixed-length character string.
- `varchar(n)` is a variable-length character string with a maximum length of n.
- `date` stores the date.
- `time` stores the time of day.
- `timestamp` stores the date and time of day.
- `interval` stores an interval of time.
### Sqlalchemy - Object Relational Mapper
- `sqlalchemy` allows you to work with Python objects that map to database tables, which can make your code more Pythonic and object-oriented. 
### psql - terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL
- `psql` is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results.
basic commands
- `\l` // list all databases
- `\c` // connect to a database
- `\dt` // list all tables in the current database
- `\q` // quit
